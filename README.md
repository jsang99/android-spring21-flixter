Submitted by: **Jiyan 'Kevin' Sang**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode. 

* [ ] Display a nice default placeholder graphic for each image during loading (read more about Glide). If you're running your app on an emulator, you can change the network speed of the emulator to test this feature by following the guidance here.

* [ ] Improve the user interface through styling and coloring (1 to 5 points depending on the difficulty of UI improvements)

* [ ] For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones. (2 points)
